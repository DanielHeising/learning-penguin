i want a second panel on the website. It should be to the right of what we have now. 
I want it to be a modifiable calender with events. 
The calender should display months and days within the month ordered by weeks liek a normal calender. 
It should not be static but with a start and endpoint which can be set.  
The calenders events on days should be modifieable via a drag and drop principle. 
you should be able to click on an event and then a window opens with infomration on that event.
